## Installing Rust and Cargo

I downloaded Rustup from https://win.rustup.rs/x86_64, ran the installer, and got the following result:

Then I Installed Cargo-Concordium from https://distribution.concordium.software/tools/windows/signed/cargo-concordium_2.7.0.exe, renamed it to "cargo-concordium.exe", and moved it to my ".cargo\bin" folder.
Giving an individual file permission to run does not apply to Windows.
