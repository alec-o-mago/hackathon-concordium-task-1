# Concordium Hackathon - Task 1

## Installing Rust

I downloaded Rustup from https://win.rustup.rs/x86_64
I executed it but got an error saying I had to install "Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Build Tools" first.

I followed the link given on the error message (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) to install it.
